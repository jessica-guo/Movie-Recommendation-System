# Movie-Recommendation-System
Our project is aiming at expanding userâ€™s movie archive and find he/she next potential favored
movie. The methodology of our project is based on a similarity comparison between movie
contents and attributes. In other words, users may get recommendations for movies based on a
series of movie tags, such as movie name, reviews, plots, genres, directors, etc.
